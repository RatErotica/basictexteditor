# basictexteditor
Really, really basic text "editor" made in VBS.
excuse the hacked together code, it was like midnight when I made this.
Either way, it's very basic.
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li>An extreme lack of loading Text Files.
  <li>Primitive UI that makes Notepad look mildy better.
  <li>Lack of proper line breaks.
</ul>
